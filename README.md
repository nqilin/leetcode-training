# LeetCode-Training
LeetCode algorithm training notes for freshman CS programmer, focusing on **easy/medium difficulty problems** (high frequency in technical interviews). Provide dual solutions (Python/C++) and detailed problem-solving ideas, solidify programming foundation and algorithm logic.
> Classified by difficulty and problem type, with clear time complexity and space complexity analysis for each problem.

## 📊 Training Repository Structure
Classified by difficulty first, then by problem type (each problem has independent code file and idea note, to be filled in).

## 🎯 Training Objective
- Master the basic algorithms and data structures (array, string, linked list, hash table, etc.);
- Cultivate algorithm thinking and problem-solving ability (analysis → design → coding → optimization);
- Be proficient in using Python/C++ for algorithm coding (dual language practice);
- Adapt to the algorithm interview requirements of software development positions and lay a foundation for future interviews.

## 🔍 Problem-Solving Standard
1. Provide **Python/C++ dual solutions** for each problem (if possible);
2. The code is with standard comments (problem-solving ideas, key logic, step explanation);
3. Analyze **time complexity (TC)** and **space complexity (SC)** for each solution;
4. Supplement problem-solving tips and optimization ideas (if there are better solutions);
5. Record the training time and difficulty evaluation for each problem.

## 📚 Training Reference
- LeetCode Official Website: Easy/Medium difficulty problems (top 100 high frequency)
- Textbook: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (Python/C++ version)
- Learning Resource: Online algorithm courses and technical blogs

## 📈 Training Plan
- Complete 1 easy problem every day (focus on basic problem types);
- Complete 1 medium problem every 2 days (focus on comprehensive problem types);
- Summarize problem-solving methods and skills every week (update Notes directory);
- Gradually increase the difficulty with the improvement of ability (no hard problems for the time being).

## 📌 For Job & Cooperation
This repository reflects my **algorithm logic ability and programming foundation**, which is the core ability required for software development positions. I am willing to communicate with other algorithm learners and share problem-solving ideas.
